Justin started his list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he had written down everything he could think of , he still had only thirty-seven . Frustrated , he shut his notebook and climbed into bed .

Calliope Minton observed the pitch and sway of an aging duke and a newly launched debutante as the two waltzed across the terrazzo floor . She could cast the duke as a tortoise and the young girl as a fresh minnow . No , what about the duke as a long-toothed wolf and the girl as a sheep ? Calliope grimaced . The duke and debutante were about as appealing as the ideas floating through her brain . Calliope was prepared to do something drastic . Even if she had to strip to her shift in the middle of the Killroys ' lavish ballroom , at least the ton could discuss something besides the weather . \\\" Spring certainly has kept its grip on winter . Is it going to be warmer anytime soon ? \\\" Miss Sarah Jones asked the small group gathered on the fringe of the Killroys ' crowded ballroom . Clasping her hands to keep from shaking the pretty debutante , Callio pe focused on a leafy philodendron in the corner . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attendance . A mousy girl stepped into view , looking nervous and uncomfortable . Calliope smiled , prompting the girl to straighten her shoulders and tentatively smile in return . Beneath the girls ' self-conscious exterior was a warm and intelligent spirit . Next time one of the fashionable girls criticized her , maybe they 'd be in for a surprise . That image was one Calliope dearly wished to publish in the London papers . Too long had the same insipid ladies and feckless gentlemen reigned supreme over the ton . Just once she wanted to see the plain but intelligent girls and lads give back as good as they got . Perhaps if they were to do it en masse ... She could form a group , create a revolution of sorts . Rise up , normal young people ! Break down the social barriers ! Overthrow the haughty elite ! Calliope 's thirst for vengeance against the upper classes took root in the idea . Yes , she could lead them . Overthrow one noble at a time . Which one first ? Voices rippled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for someone to join their group and Calliope froze as she registered the man 's jet-black hair and intense onyx eyes . The too-handsome Marquess of Angelford prowled toward her . Dark locks framed his patrician features , and wealth and privilege clung to him like a winter cloak . He was looking directly at her , his gaze washing over her . Calliope 's heart skipped several beats and she tried to still her racing pulse . Matrons and debutantes preened as Angelford passed . Calliope shifted her feet , caught between irritation and anticipation . The only thing she detested more than his conceit was her own physical response to him . One noble at a time , a voice in the back of her head said . He reached their group and acknowledged their hostess , Lady Killroy . \\\" I am so pleased you could attend our gathering , Lo rd Angelford , \\\" Lady Killroy gushed . Angelford 's arrival marked her ball a complete success . One noble at a time , the voice urged . \\\" We were discussing the dreadful weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wretched ? \\\" \\\" Mmm , yes . We were unable to run the horses last weekend . \\\" His rich voice sent warm ripples down Calliope 's spine . Sarah giggled along with Lucinda Fredericks , another pretty young debutante who tried Calliope 's patience . One noble at a time . The voice became more insistent . She plunged into the conversation . \\\" Considering the inconvenience , I ca n't believe Aeolus did n't command the winds for you , my lord . \\\" There was a collective gasp . Her once-brave internal voice hesitated and then fled . Calliope wanted to retract the sarcastic comment , but Father Time refused her entreaty . Lady Simpson looked irate . Her fan hammered against her leg . Calliope could have sworn a fleeting smile crossed Angelford 's features , but his expression became even more arrogant . \\\" Perhaps someday he will . Sometimes behavior must be taught . \\\" His deep , dark eyes mocked her . She willed the redness from her cheeks and inclined her head . A discussion of the weather , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous combination . What had she been thinking , to berate him in front of the others ? He drove her mad , but she should have waited to discreetly slice him . The titters from Sarah and Lucinda grated . \\\" No better than you deserve , \\\" Sarah said just loudly enough for Calliope to hear . Her fingers itched for ink and paper . The mass call to arms once again returned to a personal vendetta . Sarah would lose her smile when she saw the rendition of her vapid look and tart tongue in print , the image of which was already forming in Calliope 's mind . Lady Simpson snapped her ever-present fan closed , interrupting Calliope 's thought . \\\" Sometimes a bad apple sneaks past even my watchful gaze , my lord . I do try to be ever vigilant , but from time to time recommendations from some of the gentry are suspect . They tend to be less discerning than those of us with higher standards . \\\" Worry crept into Calliope 's mind . She had defi- nitely made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson 's companion . Lord , how she hated society . It was a game she could never win . Lady Killroy seized the pause , obviously eager not towaste the opportunity of having Angelford at hand . \\\" Yes , it ' s always hard to find good help . On a more interesting note , Mi ss Jones was commenting on the new Italian marble being used at the palace . She and Miss Fredericks were recently presented at St. James 's . \\\" Sarah took her cue . \\\" Oh , yes . The marble is the loveliest shade of gray . And they found these lovely plants . They looked lovely in the ... \\\" Calliope blotted out Sarah 's lovely voice , which could continue inane conversation for hours . She noticed Angelford 's boredom and felt a dash of good humor return at the thought of his being cornered by the two twits all evening ...\",\n          \"@@1009063 A Russian Folktale <p> Once , in a small village in Russia , there lived a svitnik-a tailor-who was very poor . But he felt he had the wealth of the world because he had a devoted wife who always praised him and spoke loving words to him . The tailor wished for nothing more than to make her happy . And so he toiled day and night making svita , or clothing , in the hope of earning enough money to buy lovely gifts for her . One day , while making a woman 's coat and matching hat , the tailor had a joyful thought . When he finished the clothes , he showed them to his wife . \\\" For you , \\\" he said . \\\" For me ? For me , Josef ? They are too fine for me . They are fit for the wife of the tsar , not me . \\\" Josef took his wife 's hand into his and said , \\\" Svetlana , my love , nothing is too fine for you . But I shall listen to your wisdom . I shall take them to the tsar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make a coat and hat for you exactly to your bidding . \\\" And so Josef placed the coat and hat in a large clean cloth , mounted his horse , and rode many miles to the tsar 's palace . He arrived tired , but jubilant in the thought that he had the finest gift in the land for the tsarina . He approached the guard at the gate to the palace grounds . \\\" I have a handmade coat and hat for the tsar 's wife , and I wish entry , please , \\\" Josef said . \\\" A gift for the tsarina ? \\\" With a greedy look in his eye , the guard said , \\\" Remain here . I will deliver it for you . \\\" \\\" I need to deliver it myself to determine if she 'll need any changes , \\\" Josef replied , surprised at his own daring . The guard thought for a moment , then said , \\\" Very well . I will let you pass . But you must know that whoever gives the tsar a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever the tsar gives you . \\\" Reluctantly , Josef agreed . \\\" I shall give you one-third of whatever the tsar gives me . \\\" Then he continued on his way to the palace . He went past the orchard in full bloom and past the field of growing vegetables . Suddenly a second guard approached him . \\\" Stop , \\\" ordered the guard . \\\" What is in that package ? \\\" \\\" A handmade coat and hat for the tsarina , \\\" replied Josef . The guard eyed the valuable parcel . \\\" You need not go farther . I shall deliver it for you . You may stay here and wait . \\\" \\\" I wish to deliver it myself . \\\" Josef spoke more sternly than he had ever dared speak to anyone . The guard paused in thought . \\\" Surely you know that whoever gives the tsar a gift will be granted one wish . I will let you deliver it , but I want one-third of whatever the tsar gives you . \\\" Josef sighed . \\\" I promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stables , past the meadow filled with grazing horses , cows , and bulls , past the chicken house . At last he was near the palace doors . But before he could enter , he was met by a third guard . \\\" And where do you think you are going ? \\\" said the guard . \\\" I am going to see the tsar , \\\" replied Josef . \\\" I have a handmade coat and hat for the tsarina . \\\" The guard smiled greedily . \\\" I am the chief guard . I 'll be happy to deliver them for you . \\\" \\\" I must deliver them myself , \\\" Josef said firmly . \\\" The tsarina may need changes made . \\\" Sensing Josef 's determination , the guard said , \\\" I will permit you to do that . But you may know that the tsar offers one wish to the giver of a gift , and if I let you enter the palace , I want one-third of whatever the tsar gives you . \\\" Josef had expected this reply . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You shall have one-third . \\\" At last Josef entered the palace and presented his gift to the gracious tsarina . As she tried on the new coat and hat , the tsar looked on admiringly . \\\" Thank you , Josef , \\\" the tsarina said . \\\" This is a most elegant coat and hat . They fit me well . I shall wear them with pride . \\\" The tsar turned to Josef and said , \\\" What fine gifts you have made for my tsarina . As thanks , I will grant any request you make . \\\" Josef had already decided what he would wish for . \\\" I appreciate your generosity , my lord , \\\" said Josef . \\\" I wish for ninety-nine hours of hard labor picking fruit in the orchards and vegetables from the garden , feeding the animals , grooming the horses , milking the cows , gathering eggs , and plowing the land . Ninety-nine hours of hard labor-no less , no more . \\\" The tsar was astonished . He asked , \\\" Why would anyone make such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not for me alone , \\\" said Josef . \\\" I promised to give each of the three guards one-third of my wish , and I always keep my promises . \\\" A broad smile spread over the face of the tsar . \\\" Your wish will be granted . And since you possess intelligence as well as skill , from now on you shall be known as the Tailor of the Tsar . \\\" \\\" Tailor of the Tsar ! I ? Thank you , my lord , \\\" Josef said humbly .

Calliope Minton observed the pitch and sway of an aging duke and a newly launched debutante as the two waltzed across the terrazzo floor . She could cast the duke as a tortoise and the young girl as a fresh minnow . No , what about the duke as a long-toothed wolf and the girl as a sheep ? Calliope grimaced . The duke and debutante were about as appealing as the ideas floating through her brain . Calliope was prepared to do something drastic . Even if she had to strip to her shift in the middle of the Killroys ' lavish ballroom , at least the ton could discuss something besides the weather . \\\" Spring certainly has kept its grip on winter . Is it going to be warmer anytime soon ? \\\" Miss Sarah Jones asked the small group gathered on the fringe of the Killroys ' crowded ballroom . Clasping her hands to keep from shaking the pretty debutante , Callio pe focused on a leafy philodendron in the corner . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attendance . A mousy girl stepped into view , looking nervous and uncomfortable . Calliope smiled , prompting the girl to straighten her shoulders and tentatively smile in return . Beneath the girls ' self-conscious exterior was a warm and intelligent spirit . Next time one of the fashionable girls criticized her , maybe they 'd be in for a surprise . That image was one Calliope dearly wished to publish in the London papers . Too long had the same insipid ladies and feckless gentlemen reigned supreme over the ton . Just once she wanted to see the plain but intelligent girls and lads give back as good as they got . Perhaps if they were to do it en masse ... She could form a group , create a revolution of sorts . Rise up , normal young people ! Break down the social barriers ! Overthrow the haughty elite ! Calliope 's thirst for vengeance against the upper classes took root in the idea . Yes , she could lead them . Overthrow one noble at a time . Which one first ? Voices rippled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for someone to join their group and Calliope froze as she registered the man 's jet-black hair and intense onyx eyes . The too-handsome Marquess of Angelford prowled toward her . Dark locks framed his patrician features , and wealth and privilege clung to him like a winter cloak . He was looking directly at her , his gaze washing over her . Calliope 's heart skipped several beats and she tried to still her racing pulse . Matrons and debutantes preened as Angelford passed . Calliope shifted her feet , caught between irritation and anticipation . The only thing she detested more than his conceit was her own physical response to him . One noble at a time , a voice in the back of her head said . He reached their group and acknowledged their hostess , Lady Killroy . \\\" I am so pleased you could attend our gathering , Lo rd Angelford , \\\" Lady Killroy gushed . Angelford 's arrival marked her ball a complete success . One noble at a time , the voice urged . \\\" We were discussing the dreadful weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wretched ? \\\" \\\" Mmm , yes . We were unable to run the horses last weekend . \\\" His rich voice sent warm ripples down Calliope 's spine . Sarah giggled along with Lucinda Fredericks , another pretty young debutante who tried Calliope 's patience . One noble at a time . The voice became more insistent . She plunged into the conversation . \\\" Considering the inconvenience , I ca n't believe Aeolus did n't command the winds for you , my lord . \\\" There was a collective gasp . Her once-brave internal voice hesitated and then fled . Calliope wanted to retract the sarcastic comment , but Father Time refused her entreaty . Lady Simpson looked irate . Her fan hammered against her leg . Calliope could have sworn a fleeting smile crossed Angelford 's features , but his expression became even more arrogant . \\\" Perhaps someday he will . Sometimes behavior must be taught . \\\" His deep , dark eyes mocked her . She willed the redness from her cheeks and inclined her head . A discussion of the weather , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous combination . What had she been thinking , to berate him in front of the others ? He drove her mad , but she should have waited to discreetly slice him . The titters from Sarah and Lucinda grated . \\\" No better than you deserve , \\\" Sarah said just loudly enough for Calliope to hear . Her fingers itched for ink and paper . The mass call to arms once again returned to a personal vendetta . Sarah would lose her smile when she saw the rendition of her vapid look and tart tongue in print , the image of which was already forming in Calliope 's mind . Lady Simpson snapped her ever-present fan closed , interrupting Calliope 's thought . \\\" Sometimes a bad apple sneaks past even my watchful gaze , my lord . I do try to be ever vigilant , but from time to time recommendations from some of the gentry are suspect . They tend to be less discerning than those of us with higher standards . \\\" Worry crept into Calliope 's mind . She had defi- nitely made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson 's companion . Lord , how she hated society . It was a game she could never win . Lady Killroy seized the pause , obviously eager not towaste the opportunity of having Angelford at hand . \\\" Yes , it ' s always hard to find good help . On a more interesting note , Mi ss Jones was commenting on the new Italian marble being used at the palace . She and Miss Fredericks were recently presented at St. James 's . \\\" Sarah took her cue . \\\" Oh , yes . The marble is the loveliest shade of gray . And they found these lovely plants . They looked lovely in the ... \\\" Calliope blotted out Sarah 's lovely voice , which could continue inane conversation for hours . She noticed Angelford 's boredom and felt a dash of good humor return at the thought of his being cornered by the two twits all evening ...\",\n          \"@@1009063 A Russian Folktale <p> Once , in a small village in Russia , there lived a svitnik-a tailor-who was very poor . But he felt he had the wealth of the world because he had a devoted wife who always praised him and spoke loving words to him . The tailor wished for nothing more than to make her happy . And so he toiled day and night making svita , or clothing , in the hope of earning enough money to buy lovely gifts for her . One day , while making a woman 's coat and matching hat , the tailor had a joyful thought . When he finished the clothes , he showed them to his wife . \\\" For you , \\\" he said . \\\" For me ? For me , Josef ? They are too fine for me . They are fit for the wife of the tsar , not me . \\\" Josef took his wife 's hand into his and said , \\\" Svetlana , my love , nothing is too fine for you . But I shall listen to your wisdom . I shall take them to the tsar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make a coat and hat for you exactly to your bidding . \\\" And so Josef placed the coat and hat in a large clean cloth , mounted his horse , and rode many miles to the tsar 's palace . He arrived tired , but jubilant in the thought that he had the finest gift in the land for the tsarina . He approached the guard at the gate to the palace grounds . \\\" I have a handmade coat and hat for the tsar 's wife , and I wish entry , please , \\\" Josef said . \\\" A gift for the tsarina ? \\\" With a greedy look in his eye , the guard said , \\\" Remain here . I will deliver it for you . \\\" \\\" I need to deliver it myself to determine if she 'll need any changes , \\\" Josef replied , surprised at his own daring . The guard thought for a moment , then said , \\\" Very well . I will let you pass . But you must know that whoever gives the tsar a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever the tsar gives you . \\\" Reluctantly , Josef agreed . \\\" I shall give you one-third of whatever the tsar gives me . \\\" Then he continued on his way to the palace . He went past the orchard in full bloom and past the field of growing vegetables . Suddenly a second guard approached him . \\\" Stop , \\\" ordered the guard . \\\" What is in that package ? \\\" \\\" A handmade coat and hat for the tsarina , \\\" replied Josef . The guard eyed the valuable parcel . \\\" You need not go farther . I shall deliver it for you . You may stay here and wait . \\\" \\\" I wish to deliver it myself . \\\" Josef spoke more sternly than he had ever dared speak to anyone . The guard paused in thought . \\\" Surely you know that whoever gives the tsar a gift will be granted one wish . I will let you deliver it , but I want one-third of whatever the tsar gives you . \\\" Josef sighed . \\\" I promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stables , past the meadow filled with grazing horses , cows , and bulls , past the chicken house . At last he was near the palace doors . But before he could enter , he was met by a third guard . \\\" And where do you think you are going ? \\\" said the guard . \\\" I am going to see the tsar , \\\" replied Josef . \\\" I have a handmade coat and hat for the tsarina . \\\" The guard smiled greedily . \\\" I am the chief guard . I 'll be happy to deliver them for you . \\\" \\\" I must deliver them myself , \\\" Josef said firmly . \\\" The tsarina may need changes made . \\\" Sensing Josef 's determination , the guard said , \\\" I will permit you to do that . But you may know that the tsar offers one wish to the giver of a gift , and if I let you enter the palace , I want one-third of whatever the tsar gives you . \\\" Josef had expected this reply . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You shall have one-third . \\\" At last Josef entered the palace and presented his gift to the gracious tsarina . As she tried on the new coat and hat , the tsar looked on admiringly . \\\" Thank you , Josef , \\\" the tsarina said . \\\" This is a most elegant coat and hat . They fit me well . I shall wear them with pride . \\\" The tsar turned to Josef and said , \\\" What fine gifts you have made for my tsarina . As thanks , I will grant any request you make . \\\" Josef had already decided what he would wish for . \\\" I appreciate your generosity , my lord , \\\" said Josef . \\\" I wish for ninety-nine hours of hard labor picking fruit in the orchards and vegetables from the garden , feeding the animals , grooming the horses , milking the cows , gathering eggs , and plowing the land . Ninety-nine hours of hard labor-no less , no more . \\\" The tsar was astonished . He asked , \\\" Why would anyone make such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not for me alone , \\\" said Josef . \\\" I promised to give each of the three guards one-third of my wish , and I always keep my promises . \\\" A broad smile spread over the face of the tsar . \\\" Your wish will be granted . And since you possess intelligence as well as skill , from now on you shall be known as the Tailor of the Tsar . \\\" \\\" Tailor of the Tsar ! I ? Thank you , my lord , \\\" Josef said humbly .

\\\" amanda ask , pretend she do n't care and mad at herself because she really do . \\\" well , i guess that will be up to you , \\\" carol say with a shrug . oh , no , here go . i have hear all this before . it be up to you . you make your own decision . you live with the choice you make , \\\" amanda think . all of those line have be repeat again and again by the different caseworker who have come and go during her 15 year in the system . even though they think she be too little to understand , amanda have hear the caseworker gossip about her parent . about how her mom be unable to take care of her kid . and about how the man in her mom 's life be all the samealcoholics and lowlife . only the name change ; the rest remain the same .           be a long time . \\\" amanda shrug . they walk in on a large group of girl watch tv and talk . they all look up to check out the new arrival . after only 30 second amanda could pick out the leader and the follower . before she could far scan the room , which be clutter with mismatched furniture and bright orange carpeting , a bleached blond in a business suit come up to her . \\\" you must be amanda . we be tell you have be come today . i be barbara , the director of sunset home , \\\" the stuffed suit say , wear a fake smile and hold out a hand that amanda pretend not to see . she know these type , too-all friendly around the caseworker and then after they be go , no more smile , just work list and yell . \\\" hi , barbara , \\\" say carol , move into the situation . \\\" yes , i be carol , the new caseworker . and this be amanda , \\\" she say , smile and accept           cause she do n't have to stay here , amanda could n't help thinking . \\\" well , welcome . brenda , will you show amanda where to put her thing while we take care of some paperwork ? \\\" barbara ask . \\\" no problem , \\\" say a girl who , amanda assume , must be brenda . brenda be one of the girl amanda have pick out right away as a leader . brenda have long , stringy blond hair . amanda could n't tell how old she be . just like her , all the girl look old than they really be . they have grow up the hard way and have hard look to prove it . \\\" hi , i be brenda , \\\" the tall girl say . \\\" hi , \\\" amanda answer , relieve that brenda seem nice . she \\\" know the routine if one of the group leader do n't like you . there would be trouble right away . and no doubt she would have to fight the girl by the end of the week . amanda be           . teacher and counselor could say again and again that fighting do n't solve anything . but they do n't know how thing be in place like this . fight in these place be like survival . you either make it or you do n't . and amanda have make it so far . \\\" this be your crib , \\\" brenda say , point to a top bunk . there be four set of bunk bed , eight dresser , and eight desk fight for space in the dark , cramped room . \\\" there be eight girl in here ? \\\" amanda ask . not that she be surprised . she believe these place be nothing more than a way to get money out of the state for take in problem kid . the more they could cram in , the more money in the director 's pocket . \\\" yeah , \\\" brenda answer . \\\" what be it like here ? \\\" amanda ask . \\\" it be not too bad . you have to work a lot , but at least they do n't hit           the other girl say , make amanda secretly envious . she have never be anyplace for long than a year . she always act tough and pretend that she like to always \\\" be on the move , \\\" but inside she know better . it do n't take long for amanda to unpack , since all her worldly possession fit into a large knapsack , and she wonder what be next . probably dinner and d counseling session , amanda guess . that seem to be the nightly routine at most of the group home . like more counseling be really go to help me . do n't they know nothing be go to help me if i do n't get out of place like this ? amanda wonder . carol be just finish up her meeting with barbara as the girl walk down the stair . \\\" do you get everything put away ? \\\" carol ask . \\\" yeah-all except for the luggage , which the butler be put away now , \\\" say amanda sarcastically . the other girl in the room , who have hear           really angry . \\\" girl , that be enough ! \\\" barbara snap . \\\" break over-get back to your job ! \\\" great ! i have n't even be here a hour , and i have already make the director mad . what else be new ? amanda think . even without try she always have a way of make other people laughespecially when she be nervous . by be a clown she could hide behind the laughter and smile . she know by now that laughter be a lot better than tear . early on she have learn how to survive . she be determine not to cry in front of anyone again-ever . the only problem be that she really do n't have any feeling leave . by block out her sadness , she have also manage to block out any happy feeling . that be why she smoke mary jane . get high be the only time she ever feel happy anymore . \\\" amanda , could i see you outside a minute ? \\\" carol ask , interrupt her from her thought . \\\" ok           . now would come the usual routine talk about behave herself and work hard at school . \\\" amanda , i know you do n't want to be here , \\\" carol start . \\\" you have get that right ! \\\" amanda say sarcastically . \\\" and after talk to barbara , i be not sure that this be the place for you either , \\\" the caseworker continue . \\\" what do you mean ? \\\" ask amanda with a confused look on her pretty face . she be suddenly no long sure where this conversation be go . this be n't part of the usual caseworker routine . \\\" well , i do n't want to tell you early , but i think i may have find a foster home for you , \\\" carol say . \\\" well , then , why do we come here ? \\\" amanda ask , totally confuse at this point . \\\" i want you to see where you would be place if you do n't make it at the foster home , \\\" carol admit . \\\" oh ,           she could say . she have be at other foster home , and she know why she have nt make it there . it be easy to get kick out of the home than it be to try and make it work . actually , she really like her last foster home , but never show it . when the school call and report she have be smoking pot in the school bathroom , that be the final straw . the family decide enough be enough . \\\" i be not go to lecture you , amanda . you have hear it all before . you have get one more chance , and only you can make it , \\\" say the caseworker . \\\" where be it ? \\\" amanda ask , try not to get her hope up . \\\" it be in a new town far away from here . it be a new start , but the choice be up to you . you either make it there or come back here . do you want to try ? \\\" carol ask . \\\" yeah ,           ready to try . \\\" as amanda turn to go up the step , a tear trickle down her cheek . not remember the last time she have cry , she turn away . when she turn back around , she hand a wrapped-up tissue to carol . \\\" what be this ? \\\" the caseworker ask , somewhat confuse by the sudden act . \\\" just something i will n't be need anymore , \\\" amanda reply with the beginning of a smile start to cross her face . inside the rumpled tissue be a marijuana joint .\",\n          \"come on , nate , \\\" i say . \\\" let be go get some ice cream . \\\" you do n't have to say that twice to nate . before i could tell him \\\" tie your shoe , \\\" he leap down the front step scream , \\\" yahoo ! \\\" but he would n't go around the corner onto electric avenue without me , as a drunk have grab him once . he dance at the corner like he have to visit the bathroom . when i catch up , nate dash along to the door of vin 's . he rattle the door twice to make the bell jangle more . he stomp on the white tile floor while vin call , \\\" hello , boy . nate , you will put a hole in the floor . \\\" nate guffaw . vin say that every time we come in . we sit down at one of the little round table . a new girl work there take our order . nate place his order first . \\\" i will take the usual . malted milk with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream and extra           \\\" please . \\\" \\\" right-o , little man , \\\" say the girl . she turn her brown eye to me . they tilt up a little at the end . \\\" oh , uh . i do n't know , uh . . . \\\" nate heave a huge sigh . \\\" just get what you always get . \\\" the girl smile . \\\" let me guess . banana split ?
