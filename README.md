# AI-Bachelor-Project-2023-2024

This project was done for an Artificial Intelligence bachelor thesis at the University of Groningen. The N-gram extractor file was the code used to extract N-grams from the COCA Juvenile Fiction corpus and to analyze idiom frequencies in the data. The corpus data is restricted and therefore is not included in this repository.

The 'final idiom list.csv', as the name suggests, contains the final most frequent idioms found amongst the extracted N-grams.
