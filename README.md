# AI-Bachelor-Project-2023-2024

This project was done for an Artificial Intelligence bachelor thesis at the University of Groningen. The N-gram extractor file was the code used to extract N-grams from the COCA corpus and to analyze idiom frequencies in the data. The corpus data is restricted and therefore is not included in this repository.
