you 're my best friend 5
his head from side to 5
i 'm sure you can 5
closing the door behind him 5
in front of the painting 5
grinning from ear to ear 5
he wondered if he 'd 5
've been waiting for you 5
of the corner of his 5
the corner of his eye 5
more to it than that 5
not the end of the 5
over the top of the 5
a care in the world 5

you 're not supposed to 5
do n't know about this 5
from the corner of her 5
corner of her eye she 5
got to be kidding me 5

we 're all going to 5
get a better look at 5
the clouds in the sky 5
you 're on your own 5

but she was n't about 5
on the face of the 5
his attention back to the 5
drew in a deep breath 5
i do n't want it 5
i wo n't have to 5
there 's nothing to worry 5

as soon as i get 5
it 's going to snow 5

she rose to her feet 5
all i can do is 5
i want you to have 5
it was n't going to 5

much in the way of 5

breathed a sigh of relief 5
one way or the other 5
the corners of her mouth 5
did as he was told 5
had been one of the 5
if i did n't have 5
but you do n't understand 5
and looked up at the 5
as if he 'd just 5
for the better part of 5
know what i 'd do 5
i 'm sure that 's 5
there will be no more 5
you were supposed to be 5
along the top of the 5
the only one who could 5
he would n't be able 5
n't want anything to do 5

is that what you 're 5
there was no way she 5
in the back of his 5
had n't been in the 5
what she was going to 5
as far as she was 5
there was no reason to 5

she would n't have to 5
just the way it was 5
she dropped to her knees 5
i know how you feel 5
if there was one thing 5

at the door of the 5

her hands on her apron 5
